first you must install the script as a service. Follow this:

then you need to add both webex and chrome to the apps that are allowed to do accesibility.

webex is at this path:
/Users/ed/Library/Application Support/WebEx Folder/T30_MC/Meeting Center.app/Contents/MacOS/Meeting Center

to get to it (it's normally hidden) you would have to press command-shift-G and enter the path.
